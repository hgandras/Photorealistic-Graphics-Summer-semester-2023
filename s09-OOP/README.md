# Step09 - Cleanup and OOP Refactor
* Your code is waiting for general cleanup and **Object-oriented refactor**.
* If your code already is OOP (public interfaces, classes with inheritance, etc.)
  then your work is done.
* Otherwise you you should stop, look at your code with perspective, and try
  to reorganize it so that it'll be a joy to read and extend it.
* Think about future **persistence** of your objects (i.e. how will they be
  loaded from the configuration/scene-definition file).
